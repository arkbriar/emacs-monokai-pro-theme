* Monokai Pro themes for Emacs

** Preview

[[./preview.png]]

** Installation

*** package.el

monokai-pro-theme is available in [[https://melpa.org/#/monokai-pro-theme][MELPA]].

You can install it with the following command:

#+begin_src text
  M-x package-install monokai-pro-theme
#+end_src

To load one of the themes on emacs startup, add this to your init
file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'monokai-pro t)
#+end_src

*** use-package

The use-package block is fairly similar to package.el.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package monokai-pro-theme
    :ensure t
    :config
    (load-theme 'monokai-pro t))
#+end_src

Note that use-package tries to defer packages if at all possible, so
you may need to add =:demand= to the use-package block.

** Development

Above, there's a use-package block listed for general use, but if you
want to run these themes out of the git repo, there's a bit more work
which needs to be done. I use something similar to the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package monokai-pro-theme
    :ensure nil
    :load-path "site-lisp/monokai-pro-theme"
    :config
    (load-theme 'monokai-pro t))
#+end_src

This block assumes the repo is cloned to
~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/monokai-pro-theme. That needs to be added to the
load path (along with specifying =:ensure nil= if needed so use-package
doesn't try to grab the package from melpa). Additionally, the build
directory needs to be added to the =custom-theme-load-path= to ensure
load-theme can find the themes.
